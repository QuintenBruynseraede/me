# About me

I have a soft spot for Linux. This project is an attempt to present myself in an original way.
Try it out at [https://quintenbruynseraede.github.io/me](https://quintenbruynseraede.github.io/me).

I might implement the following at some point:
- An in-memory file system
- [Some shell utilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Unix_SUS2008_utilities) (echo, ls, cd, cat, ...).
- A text-based game (Tetris, pacman, ...)
- A way to solve the TSP in linear time
